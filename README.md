# scoreboard_tap_tn2
Flutter app to display ScoresTN2 (scorebaord_tn2) data from a ScoresReflectorTN2 (scoreboard_reflector_tm2)

The ScoresTN2 is a PWA for scoring youth sports, like volleyball.  Typically, one person keeps score on a smart phone, flashing the on going score to a video recording, or to other spectators.

Two problems occur:
1. The score keeper may not always show the score
2. The display on the phone may not be large enough

This application monitors a reflector that is populated by the ScoresTN2 application.  This allows this application to display a running update of one or more games.

NOTE: Since the first use is for Volleyball, there may be Volleyball specifics within the application.
